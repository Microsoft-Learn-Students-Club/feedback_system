The database has been connected, No issues with storing and retrieving data from the firebase, but one weird issue while performing calculations, Which can be also fixed by doing some random changes in the App.jsx file(which contains the Retrieval and Calculation code) like: adding or removing spaces in the code or something like that... and saving the file 2-3 times, but i am working on this issue and it will be gone soon...
